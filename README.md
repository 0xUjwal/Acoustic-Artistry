🎨 Acoustic Artistry - Voice to Image Generator
Acoustic Artistry is a voice-assisted image generation project that combines the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, and AI-driven image generation. Speak your imagination, and watch it come to life through visuals generated by a Stable Diffusion model.

🧠 Project Overview
This application allows users to:

Record their voice input

Convert spoken words to text using Google Speech Recognition

Generate a high-quality image based on the recognized text using the Stable Diffusion model

View and download the generated image and listen to the recorded audio

🚀 Features
🎙️ Voice-to-text conversion using SpeechRecognition

🧠 Text-to-image generation using diffusers and Stable Diffusion

⚡ Fast performance with GPU support using PyTorch

🌐 Simple and intuitive web interface using Gradio

📦 Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed. Then, run the following commands in your environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade gradio
pip install accelerate
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install diffusers
pip install torch
pip install pillow
🛠️ Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/acoustic-artistry.git
cd acoustic-artistry
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
A Gradio web interface will launch. Record your voice, and the app will:

Transcribe the audio

Generate an image based on the description

Display the results on the interface

🖼️ Example Workflow
Record Voice: Say something like "A futuristic city at night with glowing neon lights"

Speech Recognized: "A futuristic city at night with glowing neon lights"

Image Generated: The model creates an image based on this prompt.
